Assessing Risk Attributes for Personal Loans with Logistic Regression and Neural Networks | 


IDE: Python Jupyter Notebooks



•	Utilized a large dataset the took inputs age, income, and loan amount and categorical output on whether client would default on loan
•	developed a logistic regression model and data visualization utilizing pandas, NumPy matplotlib and sklearn with 88% accuracy
•	established creating a multi-level neural network with hyperparameters utilizing TensorFlow that produced an unsupervised learning model with 69% accuracy
